### A Witchy Cat Espionage & Business Simulator

Here’s a comprehensive, organized design document for **Black Cat Network**, incorporating everything discussed so far and your additional notes. The document is structured for clarity and ease of reference, with all terms in English.

---

### Core Vision

You inherit a cat shop/hotel from your missing aunt—a "crazy cat lady" who was secretly a witch. As her heir, you must:

* Uncover her disappearance (who did it, why, and how).
* Break a family curse before it claims you.
* Save your shop from a corporate megacoven’s hostile takeover.

The game is a dynamic, living-world simulator where you manage a cat business, gather intelligence, and navigate the chaotic ambitions of local witches and covens. Your cats act as both pets and spy agents, and information is your most valuable currency.

### Gameplay Pillars

#### Action Economy

* **Limited time tokens/ticks per day** for all actions.
* Balance business management, cat training, espionage, and personal goals.

#### Information Economy

* **Active Intel**: Deploy cats (or yourself) to gather specific and incidental information.
* **Passive Intel (OSINT)**: Gather leaks via radio, newspapers, and street cat gossip.
* **Information Verification**: Cross-reference sources to separate fact from rumor.

#### Espionage & Intrigue

* Use cats as **spy agents** to infiltrate homes, gather intel, and manipulate events.
* **Street cats** can be bribed, charmed, or tricked into providing information.
* **Suspicion meter**: Witches and covens grow suspicious if you’re too obvious.

#### Business Management

* Breed, train, and care for cats to fulfill **witch contracts** and keep the shop profitable.
* Avoid defaulting on your aunt’s bank loan, or lose the shop to the megacoven.

#### Mystery & Urgency

* Solve your aunt’s disappearance, break the family curse, and resist corporate acquisition—all before time runs out.

### World & Setting
